# Heart Disease Prediction App

A web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input. The app uses a machine learning model built with Python for prediction, and the frontend is developed using React.js for an interactive and responsive user experience.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows users to input health data such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
- **Prediction**: Utilizes a Python-based machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Model Integration**: Python-based machine learning model is served via an API to provide real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing and handling page navigation.

### Backend:
- **Python**: Language used to implement the machine learning model.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: Lightweight Python web frameworks to serve the machine learning model via an API.
- **Scikit-learn**: Python library used for training the heart disease prediction model.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

## Installation
